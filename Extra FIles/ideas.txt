let paddles shoot at each other like space invaders
as the paddles are damaged it becomes harder to deflect the balls

let paddles play with 2 balls and hold one with space bar

each side has a wall that must be shot / hit by the ball to create spaces where the player can pass the ball through
for points
    correctly defending your wall / goal (deflecting the ball on your side) will replace a brick?
